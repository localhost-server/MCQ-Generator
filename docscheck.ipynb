Intrastelar or vascular cambium ring formed by intra-fascicular (also called fascicular) and inter-fascicular cambium; and cork cambium (phellogen) are examples of this type of meristem.

      "Explanation : The correct answer is thick-walled tracheids; Gymnosperms are also known as soft wood because the walls of the tracheids are thin. Tracheids impart strength to the cells. It is an integral component of the xylem. The wood of gymnosperm is non-porous because it consists of lesser xylem fibres than angiosperms, the vessels are absent and it contains more tracheids than angiosperms. Due to the lesser number of vessels, and the high percentage of tracheids doesn't allow rapid conduction of water. \n",

      "Explanation : The correct answer is Companion cells move sugar and amino acids into and out of the sieve elements. In \"source\" tissue such as leaf companion cells use transmembrane proteins to take up sugar and amino acids by active transport. Movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the source, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube.

Intercalary meristem is internodal in position and is found in the stem of grasses and other monocotyledonous plants. In early stages the internode is wholly or partially meristematic but later on some of its parts become matured more rapidly than the rest so a definite continuous sequence of development is maintained i.e., mature tissue left behind whereas new ones grow which later shows variable length. \n",

This central inactive region was called quiescent centre by Clowes. The cells of this region have lesser amount of RNA and DNA so they have small nuclei. These cells also have a lower rate of protein synthesis. Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum are less developed. The cells of the quiescent centre are usually inactive.

      "Hint : Xylem and phloem \n",
      "Explanation : The correct answer is (I), (II), (III) and (IV) only; thus Within a vascular bundle, when xylem and phloem are arranged in an alternate manner on different radii, the arrangement is called as 'radial'. Such, arrangement is present in root. In monocot stem vascular bundles are conjoint and closed (without cambium). Open vascular bundles have cambium and the possibility of further xylem and phloem. Endarch is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root and the xylem develops from the inside outwards towards the periphery, i.e., centrifugally. The protoxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the metaxylem closest to the periphery. The stems of monocots typically have endarch development. Vascular bundles in monocot roots are radial, polyarch and exarch. Large number (more than 6) of xylem and phloem groups alternate with each other.

      "Correct Answer : d \n",
      "Hint : cambium is absent. \n",
      "Explanation : The correct option is Cambium is absent; Monocotyledons, also known as monocots, are flowering plants that resemble grass and often have only one cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in their seeds. A vascular bundle is a part of the transport system of vascular plants. The actual transport takes place in the stem, which comes in the xylem and phloem forms. In plants, the tissue layer known as the cambium provides cells that are only partially differentiated for plant growth. It is located where the xylem and phloem meet. Monocotyledons lack a cambium in their vascular bundles. The vascular bundles in a monocotyledonous stem are often dispersed throughout the ground tissue rather than grouped in a circle. As in many dicotyledonous species, there is no distinct pith in this species.\n",
      "The xylem of the bundles is already pointed in the direction of the middle of the stem, just like in dicots. Contrary to dicots, monocotyledonous plants' vascular bundles do not have a layer of meristematic tissue (cambium). Thus, the vascular bundles of monocots are said to be closed since no new cells can grow inside of them, whereas the vascular bundles of dicot plants can. \n",

      "Hint : Small sized tracheary elements \n",
      "Explanation : In most of the gymnosperms, like conifers and cycads, vessels are absent and the wood is made entirely of tracheids. Such wood is known as nonporous. In angiosperms, on the other hand, the wood consists of both tracheids and vessels. The wide vessels appear as pores between otherwise small sized tracheary elements. Such a wood is known as porous. In porous wood, if vessels have essentially equal diameters and are uniformly distributed throughout the ring, the wood is known as diffuse porous. It is characteristic of plants growing in tropics. \n",

      "Explanation : Extrastelar secondary growth means growth in the cortical region, external to stele; For extrastelar secondary growth the cork cambium or phellogen develops in the region outside the vascular tissue. This gives rise to cork or phellem and secondary cortex or phelloderm. All the three layers (i.e, cork, cork cambium and secondary cortex) together constitute periderm. Fascicular and interfascicular cambuim occurs in the stelar regions. \n",

      "Correct Answer : a \n",
      "Hint : Dark coloured wood \n",
      "Explanation : The correct answer is Heartwood or duramen is the dark coloured wood near the centre of the axis formed after many years of secondary growth of stem. A small outer region, however, remains light colored. It is known as sap wood or alburnum. The heartwood is formed due to changes in the elements of the secondary xylem. As secondary growth proceeds most of the older elements of secondary xylem lose water and become filled with organic compounds such as oils, gums, resins, tannins, aromatic and colouring materials. The wood becomes dark coloured due to accumulation of these substances and is also termed as duramen. The sap wood is the light coloured region of the secondary xylem. Cells of this region are functionally active. The elements of the secondary xylem added by cambial activity are those of sap wood. But gradually most of these elements get transformed into heart wood. Thus the amount of heart wood increases as the tree grows older. The amount of sap wood, however, remains almost constant. \n",

Endarch is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root and the xylem develops from the inside outwards towards the periphery, i.e., centrifugally. The protoxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the metaxylem closest to the periphery. The stems of monocots typically have endarch development. Vascular bundles in monocot roots are radial, polyarch and exarch. Large number (more than 6) of xylem and phloem groups alternate with each other.

       "   'Explanation': \"The correct option is Cambium is absent; Monocotyledons, also known as monocots, are flowering plants that resemble grass and often have only one cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in their seeds. A vascular bundle is a part of the transport system of vascular plants. The actual transport takes place in the stem, which comes in the xylem and phloem forms. In plants, the tissue layer known as the cambium provides cells that are only partially differentiated for plant growth. It is located where the xylem and phloem meet. Monocotyledons lack a cambium in their vascular bundles. The vascular bundles in a monocotyledonous stem are often dispersed throughout the ground tissue rather than grouped in a circle. As in many dicotyledonous species, there is no distinct pith in this species.\\nThe xylem of the bundles is already pointed in the direction of the middle of the stem, just like in dicots. Contrary to dicots, monocotyledonous plants' vascular bundles do not have a layer of meristematic tissue (cambium). Thus, the vascular bundles of monocots are said to be closed since no new cells can grow inside of them, whereas the vascular bundles of dicot plants can.\",\n",

As secondary growth proceeds most of the older elements of secondary xylem lose water and become filled with organic compounds such as oils, gums, resins, tannins, aromatic and colouring materials. The wood becomes dark coloured due to accumulation of these substances and is also termed as duramen. The sap wood is the light coloured region of the secondary xylem. Cells of this region are functionally active. The elements of the secondary xylem added by cambial activity are those of sap wood.
